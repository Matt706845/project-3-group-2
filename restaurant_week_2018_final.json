The bar area is a prelude to their Nuevo Latino cuisine in the dining room that will knock your taste buds for a loop. If you’re in need of a quick jump-start, Calle Ocho will get your motor running.

   "description": "La Masseria Restaurant is inspired from ancient fortified farmhouses that in the Puglia Region of Italy are called “Masseria”. Executive Chef/Co-Owner, Pino Coladonato, grew up on a Farm in Puglia. He was forced to eat whatever was available but soon was tired of bean puree and decided to take matters into his own hands, creating new ways to use the same few ingredients. Now, with limitless ingredients to choose from, fava beans, chickpeas and lentils are still a core element in many of his entrees. Interior Designer Libby Langdon has created a warm, inviting dining atmosphere. Rustic and relaxed, with plenty of old world charm. Oversize iron sconces custom made from antique wrought iron gates punctuate the walls, and artful displays of antique farm tools mixed with various authentic Italian photographs all add to the farmhouse appeal. The 250-bottle wine list encompasses all regions of Italy with few of the best American and the rest of the world.",

Critics agree that Molyvos serves perhaps the finest example of Greek cuisine in New York, and beyond. People from around the world have discovered that Molyvos serves the true foods and wines of Greece, along with a large dose of the country’s warm and lively spirit.  Molyvos’ menu is built upon the home-style cooking of Greece using authentic recipes, classical cooking techniques and superior ingredients.  The wine list, under the keen direction of Kamal Kouiri, is unique for its depth and breadth of excellent Greek labels and small producers from the Mediterranean whose wine deserves to be enjoyed.  Molyvos also boasts a carefully selected Pre and Post-theatre menu that perfectly accompanies an evening of entertainment.",

Wine-marinated octopus legs are also charcoal-grilled, resulting in astounding flavor and not a hint of rubberness. Classics like garlicky skordalia, fava beans, sauteed chicken livers over lentils, and spanakopita are all best-of-breed versions, the latter prepared as a platter of bite-sized pies. A sizeable portion of moussaka, consisting of layers of juicy ground lamb and eggplant, tied together by a superlative béchamel.

As Boston’s culinary tastes evolved, he transformed the location into a destination. He retooled the menu, the space, the wine list. The new Davio’s soon garnered rave reviews.The idea behind Davio’s Northern Italian Steakhouse was simple, regional Italian foods with a focus on the grill.Everything made by hand from the best ingredients. Serve everything from aged steaks to simple-yet-unique pasta creations. Mirror this philosophy in the kitchen with our expert and attentive staff in the dining room, seeing to your every need and taking pride in your enjoyment of the meal. Davio's has since opened locations in Philadelphia, Foxborough, MA, Atlanta, Chestnut Hill, MA, Lynnfield, MA and Manhattan.",

It is known as a type of traditional cuisine, which features fresh ingredients grilled in proximity of guests' own eyes. Foods are cooked on open-flame, its ancient but healthy grilling method of dropping excess oil has attained its popularity, and has spread throughout Japan. And now it comes to New York!Please note this online reservation is for the Robata counter seating. ",

When Mercer Kitchen opened in 1998, it immediately became a destination for New Yorkers, celebrities, and tourists. Situated in the basement of a historic building constructed in the 1800s, the… restaurant was designed by Christian Liaigre as a combination of industrial and classic modernism. Chef Jean-Georges’ American menu features market-driven, seasonal ingredients prepared in a simple yet elegant style, with favorites like the Tuna Spring Roll, Steamed Shrimp Salad, wood-fired pizzas, and classic Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake.

Not unlike the game, Mexican cuisine is unique, varied and steeped in tradition. With the cultural touchstone of La Lotería at its core, the restaurant will introduce to New York’s sophisticated palate an exciting and surprising mix of Mexican recipes, ranging from the deliciously elemental “street” taco, to the luscious lobster quesadilla.

Benchmark's rich history and naturally rustic interior is enhanced by warm exposed brick, arched windows and spacious garden seating.",
